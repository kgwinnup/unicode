# Unicode library for javascript/typescript

This is a library that enables unicode category matching. This will provide efficient lookup of character sets and
lazily build out all tables as needed. The primary purose of this unicode library is for writing parsers that need to
understand unicode. The example below creates a set of unicode categories that could be used for say "identifiers" or
"start identifiers".

All unicode tables are autogenerated from the `unicode.txt` file found
[here](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/category).

For some reason, in the `unicode.txt` file all letters (upper and lowercase) are grouped under the same category of
`L&`. For these the name is converted to just `L` and there is no distinction between upper and lower case by this
package.

# Usage

```
import { Char, Unicode, UnicodeCategory } from "@kgwinnup/unicode";

const uc = new Unicode([UnicodeCategory.Lu, UnicodeCategory.Ll]);

if (uc.lookup('A'.charCodeAt(0)) == true) {
    console.log("part of set")
}

if (uc.lookup(Char.A) == true) {
    console.log("part of set")
}
```
